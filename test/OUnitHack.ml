(* This is a hack to set the name of the test library to "topology" instead of
"dummy", which is the default. Core ships with all its unit tests in the
dummy library. So, if we link to core, then we first run the core test suite
before we run ours (which takes time).

The advertised way to set the library name is to send "-pa-ounit-lib libname"
as a flag to camlp4:

But, this turns out to be hard/impossible to do with ocamlbuild:

The solution below works just fine. *)
let _ =
  Pa_ounit_lib.Runtime.unset_lib "dummy";
  Pa_ounit_lib.Runtime.set_lib "topology"
